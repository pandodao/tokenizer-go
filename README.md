When we attempted to fulfill this requirement, we couldn't find a readily available Go package to use. Due to time constraints, we resorted to a workaround by calling JavaScript instead. However, this approach was not elegant and not very efficient. Now there is a native Go package implementation available at https://github.com/pkoukk/tiktoken-go, please prioritize using it.

# tokenizer-go

tokenizer-go is a Go package that simplifies token calculation for OpenAI API users. Although OpenAI does not provide a native Go package for token calculation, tokenizer-go fills the gap by embedding an implementation of an npm package and extracting the results through JavaScript calls. This allows you to use tokenizer-go just like any other Go package in your projects, making it easier to work with token calculations in the Go programming language.

## Install

```shell
# Use as a module
go get -u github.com/pandodao/tokenizer-go

# Use as a command line program
go install  github.com/pandodao/tokenizer-go/cmd/tokenizer@latest
```

## Usage

* As a module
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/pandodao/tokenizer-go"
)

func main() {
	t := tokenizer.MustCalToken(`Many words map to one token, but some don't: indivisible.

Unicode characters like emojis may be split into many tokens containing the underlying bytes: ü§öüèæ

Sequences of characters commonly found next to each other may be grouped together: 1234567890`)
	fmt.Println(t) // Output: 64

	// Output: {Bpe:[7085 2456 3975 284 530 11241] Text:[Many  words  map  to  one  token]}
	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", tokenizer.MustEncode("Many words map to one token"))

	// Output: Many words map to one token
	fmt.Println(tokenizer.MustDecode([]int{7085, 2456, 3975, 284, 530, 11241}))
}
```

* As a command line program
```
~ % tokenizer -token "hello world"
2
~ %
~ % tokenizer -encode "hello world"
{"bpe":[31373,995],"text":["hello"," world"]}
~ %
~ % tokenizer -decode "[31373,995]"
hello world
~ %
~ % tokenizer
Usage of tokenizer:
  -decode string
        tokens to decode
  -encode string
        text to encode
  -token string
        text to calculate token
~ %
```
